                <p>Hello, my name is Landon Pauley I am a student athlete in the class of 2026, I attend Keswick Christian School and play on the varsity football team. I first played football at a little league organization known as the T Birds, I then took a break not knowing how much i loved the sport. By my 6th grade year i played on the middle school team and found a passion for the sport and continued to play through my last year in middle school. Along came my freshman year and that is when i found my love for the sport of football not only was it a game but it saved me and i felt like i was at home when i was on the field. My freshman summer i found how much of a passion i had and began to work and started setting goals and i accomplished those goals this year and im still shooting for a higher standard. Football taught me many lessons like how to push through pain and struggle to reach your goals and never be satisfied knowing you can do better. My current 23-24 season i based off one quote said by jammal williams and it said - "Everbodys great when they not tired, champions is when they tired that's when the real champions come out."</p>
